            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                ISPs provides consumers with access to the internet.
                They want to have control over internet traffic restrictions.
                In the past, ISPs have had to treat all internet traffic equally.
                However, in the recent past, slowing or blocking certain websites
                is legal as long as the company makes their policies known.
                This step away from net-neutrality definietly benefits these companies,
                as they now have even more control over one of the world's most important resources.<br>
                E.g. Verizon, AT&T, Optimum

            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Internet Content Providers</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                ISPs provides users with access to content such as videos or news.
                They do not want the ISPs to have control over internet traffic, as that would mean control over them.
                They say that net-neutrality helps to provide freedom of information exchange, promotes competition,
                and innovation for internet services, and helps uphold standardization of internet data transmission.
                These are all vital components to the internet. This policy would help the content providers, as it would
                disallow ISPs of controlling what content users have access to.<br>
                E.g. Youtube, Facebook, Instagram
            </span>
        </div>
        <div class="section1">
            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Everyday Internet Users</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                Everyday users are people like you and me, who use the internet for work, recreation, or both.
                They do not want ISPs to have control over the internet traffic, as they want autonomy. Similar
                to content providers, this group is in support of net-neutrality. However, there is a difference
                in reason for support. While content creators support it for the benefit of their business, and
                therefore monetary gain, everyday users simply want to decide what they see on the internet. 
                So, net-neutrality would benefit them.<br>

            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Discrimination by Protocol</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                This entails favoring or blocking information based on the classifications of the 
                communication protocol a computer uses. There are several qualities of the protocol
                that can influence this, such as data type, structure, and size.

            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Discrimination by IP Address</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                This entails favoring or blocking information based on the IP address the data was sent
                from. An IP address is a unique signature of a computer, and contains geographical information
                as well. This allows ISPs to block traffic based off of the location of the requester.

            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Favoring Private Networks</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                This entails favoring or blocking certain internal network requests over others. This
                results in ISPs allowing their own internal traffic to have priority over other traffic,
                which is unfair, and could give them advantages over other companies in certain cases.

            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Peering Discrimination</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                This occurs when ISPs partner with a company, and give them priority transit across
                the network. For example, in 2014, Netflix partnered with Comcast to increase their
                speed. They recorded a speed increase of 66%.

            <h4 class="subsectionheader">Favoring Fast-Loading Sites</h4>
            <span class="subsectionbody">
                Pages that load faster will have higher priority than slower-loading webpages. One
                study found that this could lead to 11% fewer page views, and a 16% decrease in viewer
                satisfaction. This is bad for both users and content providers.

    <h2 class="sectionheader">The Solution</h2>
    <div class="main_" id="solutions">
        <span class="solutionbody">
            Net-neutrality is a necessary policy for the internet to remain active and health 
            in modern society. With the ever increasing amount of people using the internet,
            its openness and accessibility has never been more important. I think that ISPs
            should not be allowed to control internet traffic, as it gives them too much power.
            No one should be able to decide what individuals search on the internet.
            This would be good for content providers, as they would have more global traffic, and
            good for the users, as it guarentees their rights. ISPs would not be as happy, as they
            would lose power.
