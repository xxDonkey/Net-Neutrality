## Technical Details

#### There are several different ways in which ISPs can restrict network travel.
- Discrimination by protocol: favoring or blocking information based on the classifications of the communication protocol a computer uses.
- Discrimination by IP address: favoring or blocking information based on the IP address the data was sent from
- Favoring private networks: favoring or blocking certain internal network requests over others
- Peering discrimination: ISPs partner with a company, and give them priority transit   
- Favoring fast-loading websites: Pages that load faster will have higher priority than slower-loading webpages
